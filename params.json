  "body": "# WebLED\r\n####Student Name:  Conor Farrell\r\n\r\nOriginal Concept:\r\nThe project is a simple home automation system. The original idea was to sense a user using either a mobile phone an ultrasonic sensor or some other method. \r\nOnce a user has been identified, the system can turn on lights, play music etc.. An RGB LED may be used to provide a form od 'mood lighting' where the colour of the light can change depending on a number of factors based on the user's preferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n####What happened to that?\r\nDue to technical difficulties with Wyliodrin, this was changed to a web API controlling a relay. Suppose it stil counts?\r\n\r\n## Tools, Technologies and Equipment\r\n\r\nThe final system uses an Intel Galileo with the Grove shield and components. The system uses a Grove LCD and a relay to facilitate home automation. The Wyliodrin platform is used to tie the system together and also hosts a small web server on the Galileo to process requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
