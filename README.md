# WebLED
####Student Name:  Conor Farrell

#Original Concept:
The project is a simple home automation system. The original idea was to sense a user using either a mobile phone an ultrasonic sensor or some other method. 
Once a user has been identified, the system can turn on lights, play music etc.. An RGB LED may be used to provide a form od 'mood lighting' where the colour of the light can change depending on a number of factors based on the user's preferences.


####What happened to that?
Due to technical difficulties with Wyliodrin, this was changed to a web API controlling a relay. Suppose it stil counts?

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

The final system uses an Intel Galileo with the Grove shield and components. The system uses a Grove LCD and a relay to facilitate home automation. The Wyliodrin platform is used to tie the system together and also hosts a small web server on the Galileo to process requests. At the moment the LCD only displays the IP address of the board but this could be upgraded with a message facility, enabling a user to write messages and leave them visible on the screen.
