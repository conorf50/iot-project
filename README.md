Project Description (subject to change):
The project is a simple home automation system. The idea is to sense a user using either a mobile phone an ultrasonic sensor or some other method.
Once a user has been identified, the system can turn on lights, play music etc.. An RGB LED may be used to provide a form od 'mood lighting' where the colour of the light can change depending on a number of factors based on the user's preferences.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

The proposed system would consist of an Intel Galileo or Arduino connected to a Grove shield and maybe an ultrasonic sensor. The shield will provide sensing of light level in the room among other things. A Raspberry Pi could be used to offload some of the processing to speed up the system. I plan to have the Galileo run Wyliodrin in order to tie the system together. A light strip or RGB LED could be used to provide crude 
mood lighting (this may be upgraded to a relay and mains powered lighting).
